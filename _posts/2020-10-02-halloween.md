KVCM will be streaming on October 31st a creepy collection of terrifying tunes hosted by [Music Motif](/shows/musicmotif/)'s own Remy. Remy will be joined by members of our own scary staff like Bosco from [The Good Foot](/shows/goodfoot/), Belen from [Saturday Night Dance Party](/shows/saturdaynightdanceparty/), and Ozzie from [The Stereo Deli Show](/shows/stereodeli/) who will be tingling your spine and bumping your goose with readings from a scary selection of 2 Sentence Horror Stories.

So join us this Halloween on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kvcmradio/" target="_blank">Twitch</a> or at <a href="https://kvcm.live/" target="_blank">KVCM.live</a>, if you dare! Muhahahahaha!
