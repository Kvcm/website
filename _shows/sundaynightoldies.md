Sunday Night Oldies is a name borrowed from a legendary Los Angeles Radio DJ named Mucho Morales who branded his Sunday Night Show with this moniker. Its foundation goes back to the early '90s when The Professor was working with legendary Los Angeles Radio DJ's Huggy Boy and Art Laboe producing and engineering this show and It features oldies from the '60s and '70s that have an L.A. vibe to them. It is a show and daypart allowing the listener to relax and unwind after a weekend and to reminisce of the good old days.
