The Saturday Night Dance Party was conceived by The Professor back in the late 90's when he was programming and consulting a radio station in the Antelope Valley. It is a program and daypart that blends 70's and 80's dance, disco, funk, and upbeat pop music into a format with limited talk and interruptions to make you feel good on a Saturday night!
