Join Robin as she spins the best tracks from the ’80s — the decade that combined music and video, and brought about a technological revolution that gave us home computers, Hypercolor t-shirts, and crimping irons. The ‘80s produced some of the greatest music ever recorded and continues to influence our pop culture today. Break out your Flashdance sweatshirts and parachute pants, and party along with Robin weekdays at 8!
