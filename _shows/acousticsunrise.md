The Acoustic Sunrise is a brand-new program and daypart that was created by The Professor in order to appease his wife, who claims that he was playing very loud and heavy rock n roll music on Saturday and Sunday mornings. She suggested playing more soft music for people to wake up to because the first four minutes of your day set the tone for the rest of your day. The music programming is comprised of artists from the last 40 years with acoustic versions of their popular songs featuring many lockdown versions from 2020.
