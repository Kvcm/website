Permanent Damage is a new podcast about the movies, TV series, music, books, and other media that have inspired us and shaped our lives, whether we want them to or not, and the growing proliferation of content that will alternately entertain, inspire, and annoy us going forward. On each episode, weâ€™ll discuss our current obsessions, both new and vintage, and connect the historical dots, as we explore their cultural significance and the process that went into their creation.
