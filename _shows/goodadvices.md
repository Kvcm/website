Good Advices is a show devoted to all things you wish your parents had taught you — and some things you’re probably glad they didn’t. Each week, Bosco Bonetti and Mousey Brown answer your advice questions despite being laughably unqualified to advise anyone.

Submit your own advice requests and angry emails to [boscobonetti@gmail.com](mailto:boscobonetti@gmail.com)
